   * @param swerve            The swerve drivebase subsystem.
   * @param vX                DoubleSupplier that supplies the x-translation joystick input.  Should be in the range -1
   *                          to 1 with deadband already accounted for.  Positive X is away from the alliance wall.
   * @param vY                DoubleSupplier that supplies the y-translation joystick input.  Should be in the range -1
   *                          to 1 with deadband already accounted for.  Positive Y is towards the left wall when
   *                          looking through the driver station glass.
   * @param headingHorizontal DoubleSupplier that supplies the horizontal component of the robot's heading angle. In the
   *                          robot coordinate system, this is along the same axis as vY. Should range from -1 to 1 with
   *                          no deadband.  Positive is towards the left wall when looking through the driver station
   *                          glass.
   * @param headingVertical   DoubleSupplier that supplies the vertical component of the robot's heading angle.  In the
   *                          robot coordinate system, this is along the same axis as vX.  Should range from -1 to 1
   *                          with no deadband. Positive is away from the alliance wall.
